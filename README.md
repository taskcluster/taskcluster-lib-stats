[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-stats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-stats)

Taskcluster's library for writing out stats.

## Requirements

This is tested on and should run on any of node `{0.12, 4, 5}`.

## Testing
You'll need to fill a file called `taskcluster-base-test.conf.json` with valid keys. There is a `taskcluster-base-test-example.conf.json` you can copy over to see which keys are needed. Then it is just a matter of `npm install` and `npm test`.
